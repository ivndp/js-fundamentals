#### Requirements
In a markdown or text file called `challenge4.md` or `challenge4.txt`, write an explanation of
- what `First Class` functions are
if the functions are treated like other variables. The functions can be assigned to any other variable or passed as an argument or can be returned by another function.

- how this concept applies in JS.
assigning to variable:
function addTwo(i) {
    return i + 2;
}

// assign the function to a variable
const plusTwo = addTwo;

// use the variable to call the function
const result = plusTwo(5);

passing as argument:
function calculation(a, b, operation) {
    return operation(a, b);
}

// defined different operation functions
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

function multiply(a, b) {
    return a * b;
}

//call calculation with different functions as argument
calculation(2, 4, add);
calculation(3, 5, multiply);

returning from functions:
function multiplier(factor) {
    return function(x) {
        return x * factor;
    };
}

const double = multiplier(2);
console.log(double(5));


- what the difference is between declaring a function and calling it

declaring a function is writing or composing a function that could be called later to let it process, is a creation
it would not give you any feedback 
e.g.
function hello() {
    return "Hello World!"
}

calling it is to let it process, is an operation
calling a function will give you a feedback if the function have been declared
e.g.
hello()

- Bonus: give examples for each explanation
